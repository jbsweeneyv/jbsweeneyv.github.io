<p>I'm really sorry I can't be with you today, but hopefully the letters and everything else will make it easier on you</p>
<p>I know you're probably wondering where I'm going with this, so let's get to it! You're special to me, and normal just doesn't feel like it cuts it. So, I decided to create this web page to highlight a few of my favorite memories of us together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are just five&nbsp;memories that stand out the most by specific date, but it's hard for me to not pick all the little moments we shared over the course of the semester working out, eating noodles, snuggling, or who knows what else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't wait to come see you soon, and I miss you so much. I think about you every day and I cannot wait to be reunited with my best friend. It gets closer and closer every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this makes you smile!</p>
