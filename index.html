									On campus I am involved with my fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi, and serve as the housing manager. This position entails facilitating requests or concerns from any of our 90+ members, as well as managing the property, including the living space for the 60 members that live on site. 
							</div>
							<div class="text">
									It has left me well equipped to deal with delegation, interaction with multiple entities, the coordination of projects, and the opportunity to lead a team of four members to handle the day to day operations of the fraternity house.
