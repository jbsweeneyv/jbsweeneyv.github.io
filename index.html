<p>I'm really sorry I can't be with you today, but hopefully the letters and everything else will make it easier on you</p>
<p>I know you're probably wondering where I'm going with this, so let's get to it! You're special to me, and normal just doesn't feel like it cuts it. So, I decided to create this web page to highlight a few of my favorite memories of us together. I hope you'll overlook my absolutely terrible Illustrator skills combined with my very bad web design skills!</p>

<p>September 10th</p>
<p><em>Our First Date</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>First Date Map Goes Here</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I loved this date so much. You came into my life like such a breath of fresh air that was absolutely needed, I loved it so much. As we walked down from Kroeber to Asha I was so excited but also so nervous it was crazy. The conversation made the time fly by, and the bookstore was a great touch as well. I still remember talking to you about our favorite books, just life in general, you trying to convince me to roll with you, and most of all you trying to touch a small child. You're phenomenal, and I love you so much.</p>

<p><em>Sneaking into the Greek Theater</em></p>

<p>Admittedly I don't remember the very beginning of this night very well thanks to our good friend Triple Rock. I do however remember leaving and going on a walk through campus with you, stopping to pee real quick in the grove near VLSB. Thank god you didn't think I was too weird! As we worked our way to Kroeber and I kissed you (again, absurdly nervous) for the first time I was so excited. Shortly after we took off after a few people in Rally committee towards Haas, and eventually decided we needed to sneak in somewhere. Since it was Football season we decided the field was a poor choice and went for the Greek Theater. I didn't know what it was about you, but you just made me feel so alive and wanting to do crazy fun things. I now just know that as part of your personality, but at the time I had no idea how incredible you really were. We sat and talked again as I tried to drink in every second of the night, and I truly will remember it forever. I knew that night that you were special to me, and I was going to work as hard as I had to in order to impress you and show you how important you were to me. The more I hung out and talked to you the more and more excited I got about who you were and hanging out with you.</p>

<p>Dinner at Mua</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>November 5th</p>
<p>Told you I loved you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just five&nbsp;memories that stand out the most by specific date, but it's hard for me to not pick all the little moments we shared over the course of the semester working out, eating noodles, snuggling, going to Muir Woods entirely on a whim, or who knows what else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't wait to come see you soon, and I miss you so much. I think about you every day and I cannot wait to be reunited with my best friend. It gets closer and closer every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this makes you smile!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love you Tryn Annelise &lt;3 Happy Valentine's Day my Love.</p>
