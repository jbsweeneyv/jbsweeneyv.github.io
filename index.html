<p>I'm really sorry I can't be with you today, but hopefully the letters and everything else will make it easier on you</p>
<p>I know you're probably wondering where I'm going with this, so let's get to it! You're special to me, and normal just doesn't feel like it cuts it. So, I decided to create this web page to highlight a few of my favorite memories of us together. I hope you'll overlook my absolutely terrible Illustrator skills combined with my very bad web design skills!</p>

<p>September 10th</p>
<p><em>Our First Date</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>First Date Map Goes Here</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I loved this date so much. You came into my life like such a breath of fresh air that was absolutely needed, I loved it so much. As we walked down from Kroeber to Asha I was so excited but also so nervous it was crazy. The conversation made the time fly by, and the bookstore was a great touch as well. I still remember talking to you about our favorite books, just life in general, you trying to convince me to roll with you, and most of all you trying to touch a small child. You're phenomenal, and I love you so much.</p>

<p><em>Sneaking into the Greek Theater</em></p>

<p>Admittedly I don't remember the very beginning of this night very well thanks to our good friend Triple Rock. I do however remember leaving and going on a walk through campus with you, stopping to pee real quick in the grove near VLSB. Thank god you didn't think I was too weird! As we worked our way to Kroeber and I kissed you (again, absurdly nervous) for the first time I was so excited. Shortly after we took off after a few people in Rally committee towards Haas, and eventually decided we needed to sneak in somewhere. Since it was Football season we decided the field was a poor choice and went for the Greek Theater. I didn't know what it was about you, but you just made me feel so alive and wanting to do crazy fun things. I now just know that as part of your personality, but at the time I had no idea how incredible you really were. We sat and talked again as I tried to drink in every second of the night, and I truly will remember it forever. I knew that night that you were special to me, and I was going to work as hard as I had to in order to impress you and show you how important you were to me. The more I hung out and talked to you the more and more excited I got about who you were and hanging out with you.</p>

<p><em>I Want to be With You</em></p>
<p>This was yet another night brought to you by Triple Rock! I know you&nbsp;think I love it there because of the monkey heads, and they are certainly a part of it. But it's also because all of my early and favorite memories of Triple Rock are permeated by or centered around you. I've always had such a great time with you there, and this night was no exception. After I promptly finished three monkey heads, you managed to convince me to leave the bar and walk home with you. For reasons not fully known to me we sat down in the grass by the Campanile and as usual, got lost in conversation. The more we talked, the conversation turned to wanting to date and&nbsp;for reasons not really known to me at the time, you said yes! I was so excited and couldn't really contain it. The next morning, you coyly asked me if I had remembered anything, especially from our conversation. Little did you know that conversation would be burned into my brain over time!</p>

<p><em>MUA!</em></p>
<p><em>Photo of her eating? Can't find it....</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a fantastic night, the food was great, you looked like a million bucks with your cute white top and green pants wearing one of the best looking smiles on your face that I've ever seen. I just will always love how we walked along the lake drunk and just talking about everything, about our view on money, family, and all the things we were so thankful for. That's something I have been so glad to have found in you: a willingness to acknowledge what has been sacrificed for you and appreciation for that. Beyond that though is the desire to pay it forward for others as it has been done for you. That selflessness is unique and rare, and I always have admired that about you. I love you Tryn.</p>

<p><em>I Love You</em></p>
<p>After driving home from your parent's house for a saturday of Paella and Spanish wine, you looked over at me with a telling look in your eye. I knew what you wanted to say, and wanted to say the same to you in that moment but held off. However, I knew I couldn't hold those words back for much longer. That night we went through the last 24 questions of the 36 to develop closeness while we drank spanish wine. There was an awkward moment where I almost told you I loved you during one of the final questions regarding words you would want someone to hear if you were to die at that very moment. But with the final exercise - a four minute stare into each other's eyes in silence - I knew what the first words would be. You and I gazed into each other's eyes and you shed a tear I quickly wiped away. Once the four minutes were up I said those three words you've heard me say or read so many times since then: I love you. Such a special night with an incredible girl that I certainly won't forget. I love you Tryn!</p>

<p>These are just five&nbsp;memories that stand out the most by specific date, but it's hard for me to not pick all the little moments we shared over the course of the semester working out, eating noodles, snuggling, going to Muir Woods entirely on a whim, or who knows what else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't wait to come see you soon, and I miss you so much. I think about you every day and I cannot wait to be reunited with my best friend. It gets closer and closer every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this makes you smile!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love you Tryn Annelise &lt;3 Happy Valentine's Day my Love.</p>
